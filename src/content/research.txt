### Human life history evolution and cooperative breeding

I developed interest in human behavioral ecology and life history theory during my studies of biology when attending Eckart Voland's lectures on _Biophilosophy_ at Gießen. For my [Diploma Thesis (pdf)](pdf/Johow-DA_2009.pdf) written in 2009, I have analyzed kin effects on interbirth intervals in a historical population of the Krummhörn (Ostfriesland, Germany) during 18th and 19th centuries. During [my graduate studies (pdf)](http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2013/9371/pdf/JohowJohannes_2013_03_07.pdf), I continued this research, focusing on lineage-specific grandmother effects on maternal fertility and survival. From 2012 to 2015, I worked in a project on extended family networks funded by the German Research Council (DFG). Some of the results from this research are described in [this poster (pdf)](pdf/hbes14.pdf)), I presented in 2014 on the annual conference of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society in Natal (Brazil).
