<p>I am working with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) on a regular basis since 2009, mostly out of needs of [my research](research). Typical applications include the management and analysis of spatiotemporal event histories within large (historical) genealogies, modelling of multistate event histories, and generation of dynamic reports including development of suitable visualization methods. Both <a href="pdf/Johow-DA_2009.pdf">my diploma thesis</a> and <a href="http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2013/9371/pdf/JohowJohannes_2013_03_07.pdf">my dissertation</a> have been written by using R/LaTeX (recently via <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a>).</p>
