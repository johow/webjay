# coding

My most recent projects include
- A [shinyapp](https://johow.shinyapps.io/PedigreeShiny2) demonstrating the functionality of my [kinlab](https://www.github.com/johow/kinlab) package for R.  
- A [shinyapp](https://johow.shinyapps.io/confproc) for the automated generation of the book-of-abstracts for scientific conferences, [see code on Github](https://www.github.com/johow/confpro).  
- The [static site generator](https://www.github.com/johow/webjay) building these pages.  
  
I am working with [R](https://cran.r-project.org) on a regular basis since 2009, mostly out of needs of [my research](research.html). Both [my diploma thesis](pdf/Johow-DA_2009.pdf) and [my dissertation](http://geb.uni-giessen.de/geb/volltexte/2013/9371/pdf/JohowJohannes_2013_03_07.pdf) have been written with R/LaTeX, recently via [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/).
